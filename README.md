## About

I started learning Rust on November 30, 2023.

Blocks are the ways I organize my code. I try to continuously build upon my
learnings and I realized that having a single repository by language is a great
way to do that. So just as I did for Swift and JavaScript/CSS, this is the
repository for my Rust code.

I wish I had done the same for C when I was a student. ðŸ‘´

## Status

I am just starting my learning journey reading the Rust Book.
