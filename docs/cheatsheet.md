- Create a new project: `cargo new new_project`
- What works without importing things with `use` is called the _prelude_.
  Details are here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html
- `String` is a string type provided by the standard library that is a growable,
  UTF-8 encoded bit of text.
